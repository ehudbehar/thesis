This thesis presents the results of the experimental study of various plasma processes in gas--filled capillary discharge.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Study of the discharge evolution and possibility to obtain low jitter of discharge ignition.
  \item Study of plasma channel characteristics -- demonstration of optical guiding.
  \item Spectroscopy analysis on the plasma utilizing Stark broadening to derive the plasma's emission spectra and derive plasma channel profile.
  \item Development of multi stage capillary --- fish bone approach.
\end{enumerate}
