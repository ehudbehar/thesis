Why RDP forms:
From \href{https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5022817}{This article}:

In the gas-filled capillary discharge, the plasma channel is formed by the temperature profile during discharge, which is higher in the center due to the Ohmic heating effect of plasma and drops radially because the heating is balanced by heat conduction to the capillary wall. As the gas pressure is almost uniform, the radial plasma density has quasi-quadratic profile.
